The upper date range in some cases extends to around 100 AD, although the great majority of datasets date no later than 600 BC. Correctness and completeness were pursued for all information relevant to stature, i.e. basic information such as sex (after Sjøvold 1988) and age (after Szilvássy 1988) as well as the long bone measurements, whereas other measurements were merely inherited from the two integrated older data bases and not explicitly checked. All measurements conform to the definitions given by Martin 1928.
